Python code needed to run the synapse detection code.  The package needed can be installed using the instructions here: https://aksimhal.github.io/SynapseAnalysis/SynapseDetection. 

- populate_queries_fragileX.py creates JSON query files needed to run synapse detection 

- run_fragX.py runs the synapse detection algorithm using the JSON files previously created. 

- run_fragX_astro.py run the synapse detection algorithm for triparte synapses using the JSON files previously created.
