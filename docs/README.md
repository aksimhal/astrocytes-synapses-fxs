## Multifaceted Changes in Synaptic Composition and Astrocytic Involvement in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome

Welcome to the code and data respository for our paper, "Multifaceted Changes in Synaptic Composition and Astrocytic Involvement in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome." Each folder in this repository has a readme which explains the contents of the folder and how to access them. To access the repository, please click the "View the Project on Github" link on the left sidebar. The repository contains information on how to install the probabilistic synapse detector (https://aksimhal.github.io/SynapseAnalysis/SynapseDetection), how to formulate queries, and the code used for data analysis. The repository also includes the results compiled into excel sheets. 

The array tomography image volumes are hosted on Figshare and can be downloaded here: https://figshare.com/projects/Multifaceted_Changes_in_Synaptic_Composition_and_Astrocytic_Involvement_in_a_Mouse_Model_of_Fragile_X_Syndrome/62645.
